## Overview
### Description
An app for students at Michigan State University to make new friends and interact with other students.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Social
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer, such as tinder or other similar apps. Functionality wouldn't be limited to mobile devices, however the viewing choice would be better on the mobile.
- **Story:** Analyzes users' majors, activities that they are going to attend, and allows other users to join them for their activities and also allows students to be randomly connected with one another each day and supports a chat functionality increasing interactiveness among students.
- **Market:** Students at Michigan State University
- **Habit:** Users get randomly matched with another user everyday. Users can check the bulletin board for any discussion or social events they can join.
- **Scope:** It's primary focus is to connect students with other students at Michigan State University. The only features are the chat box, bulletin board, and profile.
